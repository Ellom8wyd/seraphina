      <h2>Entry 1: If These Walls Could Talk…</h2>
      <p>They hum. Beneath the layers of concrete and rusted rebar, I hear it: a low, vibrating resonance, as if the earth itself is whispering secrets. Last night, the fluorescent bulbs overhead flickered in perfect rhythm, exposing dark stains on the walls that vanish when you look away.</p>
      <p>I dared to map the vibrations with my recorder. At exactly <strong>03:13</strong>, the readings spiked into incomprehensible patterns—patterns that matched no known frequency.</p>
      <p>The construction logs mention “unexpected acoustic feedback,” but the redacted memos hint at something far worse: <span class="redacted">████████████████████</span>.</p>
      <p class="reveal">I glimpsed a figure moving behind the hatch, its silhouette warped by the hum.</p>
      <p>Today I found footprints in fresh dust—small, barefoot, leading deeper into corridors marked “No Entry.” I plan to follow them, though I fear what I’ll uncover.</p>

      <h2>Entry 2: The Silence That Follows</h2>
      <p>At 03:13 this morning, every screen in my apartment died simultaneously. The entire block fell into darkness for seven agonizing seconds. In that void, I felt pressure behind my eyes—like hands pressing me forward.</p>
      <p>When the power returned, the screens displayed a single line: <em>“Do not trust your eyes.”</em> I shut them off immediately, but the words seared themselves onto my mind.</p>
      <p>My camera footage from the night shows a momentary glitch: a half-smile carved into the concrete, glowing faintly before disappearing. Officially, it’s logged as “camera error,” but privately an engineer whispered, <span class="redacted">███████████████</span>.</p>
      <p class="reveal">I heard laughter echo down the service tunnel—children’s laughter—though no one should be there.</p>
      <p>I can no longer tell whether the silence that follows the hum is relief… or the calm before something far more terrifying.</p>

      <h2>Entry 3: Whispers and Warnings</h2>
      <p>There’s a murmur among the crew: some refuse to go near the sealed doors, others speak in hushed tones of “voices in the walls.” I caught two workers tracing glyphs in dust—glyphs that weren’t there the day before.</p>
      <p>Last night, I dreamed of the tunnel opening and spewing a black mist that smelled of decay. I awoke to find my notebook smeared with something dark and sticky, as if the dream had left a stain.</p>
      <p>The security feed recorded a series of distorted announcements: “Visions deceive... audio lies...”—the same phrases I’ve heard whispered in my sleep. The log is now redacted under “Executive Order 14-Δ”: <span class="redacted">███████████████████</span>.</p>
      <p class="reveal">A silhouette appears at my window at precisely 03:13—then vanishes when I blink.</p>
      <p>I fear they are watching me as much as I watch them.</p>
